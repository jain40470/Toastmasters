Title : "If you could travel to any historical period for a week, which era would you choose and why?"


History has always fascinated me , not just for event but for the strategies behind them.
To me , history is a battlefield of ideas where great rulers either rose through 
brilliant tactics/strategies or fells behind because of miscalculated steps.

I don't remember the exact period , but if i could travel to any era , it would be the time of 
Genghis Khan . He was not only a fierce warrior or conquerer but also a brilliant strategist.

Even with limited resources , he could make his enemies lose confidence before the battle even began , 
just with his tactics and psychological warfare.

For example : one of his most famous strategies was the feigned retreat.
His army would pretent to flee in panic , luring enemies into chase them.
Once the enemy was stretched and diorganized.
Genghis khan's hidden cavalry would strike from sides and crush them completely.
This tactic alone helped him defeat armies far larger than his town.

If i were in that period , i would love to part of that strategic council 
where every decision could cost lives. A true battleground , not on a computer 
screen but in real history where strategy meant survival.

That's why i choose to travel back to the era of Genghis Khan 
to witness firststand how vision , discipline and clever strategy 
can turn impossible odds into victory.
