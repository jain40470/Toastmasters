That's an interesting question.
If I could relive one day from my past.
It would not be the happiest or most magical day 
but rather the day , i made a mindful decision 
that still matters to me.

When i was going to buy the new phone 
Not my first but the third mobile phone of my life.
I had a card in my hand with no spending limit and 
it was completely upto me to which phone to choose.

Earlier , in 9th grade , i had bought 
iPhone X series which apples first iPhone with oled 
without any reason .To be honest , it was just to flex 
in front of cousins and friends and for four years i 
never used it in a way that justified the purchase.


But this time , things were different .
I carefully considered my needs instead of chasing 
trends or peer pressure i choose a phone that was 
practical to me , not just for the world to see.

This mindful decision still makes me proud and 
every time i look at my phone , i remember this moment.


Th message i would like to share is simple.
when buying something , think about your own needs first .
Don't let peer preesure guide your choices.

Because in the end what really matters is whether it adds value or not.
