Title : Whatâ€™s one small daily habit that has made a big difference in your life?


We all struggle with consistency , don't we ?
Every day is unique in it's own way .
Some days we feel unstoppable , full of energy that lasts for a week.
Other days , we are so drained that we end up doing nothing the following week.

This slows down progress in my learning curve . For example : 
If you learning things outside your curriculum , they demand focus and deep
understanding. If you lack consistency at any point , weeks of hard work feel wasted.

To fix this , i decided to keep things in a structured format.The structured approach has 
helped to revise faster , recall what i studied and even allows me to take breaks without losing track.

To be honest , it has been a game changer. It helped me not just in my professional life but also in making
my daily life more balanced and productive.
