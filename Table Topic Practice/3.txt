Title : If you could instantly master any skill—like painting, coding, public speaking, or
playing an instrument—which one would you choose and why?


It seems you just saw my wishlist and prepared this topic.
Coding is my profession so let's keep it out .

Yes , that's true i loved painting in my childhood , I wish to learn
guitar and  currently working on  improving my public speaking.


To be clear , I don't to plan to achieve mastery in painting and playing guitar  but
i want to enjoy them as hobbies because they help me relax.

Painting is something i lost along the way while travelling the path 
that brought me to where I am today.
As of guitar i once took took lessons but could not stay consistent.
This topic reminded me of that.

So if i had to master any skill out of these , it would definetely be public speaking.

I have a strong reason as well.

Public speaking helps me express and pitch my ideas more 
understandably and clearly , which ultimately benefits me 
both professionionaly and personally.
