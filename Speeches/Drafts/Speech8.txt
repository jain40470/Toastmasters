Have you ever noticed how much sunlight we have in India?
You step out for five minutes, and your skin gets roasted like a toast! 

And yet… when you get your health report — Vitamin D deficiency!
Everywhere, every report, same line: “Needs more sunlight.”

And I thought — “Arey bhai, what are we doing wrong?”
We have sunlight, but we aren’t absorbing it! 

And then it struck me —
That’s exactly how leadership works.
We are surrounded by opportunities, knowledge, and people who can inspire us —
but somehow, we fail to absorb those lessons.

We don’t lack resources.
We lack connection with them.

And the first connection — begins with ourselves.

[Transition – Lead Into Personal Story]

Let me share a small story that taught me this lesson.

I had a friend back in school — a brilliant painter.
We both came from business families — so the “plan” was clear:
Engineering, MBA, Business, and then… a lifelong subscription to stress! 

So, I followed the plan.
And my friend? He followed… his passion.
He chose painting — full-time!

Everyone told him, “You’re crazy! What about your future?!”
And he replied calmly, “At least I’ll create something worth looking at.” 

I used to think he was lost.
But years later, when I met him — I saw peace on his face, excitement in his eyes, and color on his hands.
Meanwhile… I was leading a life full of logic, but not much light.

That’s when I realized —
Leadership isn’t about how many people follow you.
It’s about whether you have the courage to follow yourself.

My friend didn’t just paint.
He led — by example.
He showed me that self-leadership is the foundation of every other kind of leadership.

[Transition – Shift to Broader Reflection with Humor]

But let’s be honest —
Once we grow up and enter the “real world,” something happens.
We become bureaucratic leaders.

We get so busy with plans, processes, and “Excel sheets of efficiency,”
that we forget the one column that matters most — people.

[Childhood Cricket Story – Emotional + Funny]

When I was a kid, we had 11 boys in our colony.
Every weekend, we’d pool our coins to buy one cricket ball.
We argued about batting order, fielding positions, and sometimes even whose house window we broke! 
But somehow, we always made time to play.

Now, all those boys are adults.
Each of us can buy 11 cricket balls.
But can we find 11 people to play?
Nope. Everyone’s “busy.”

That’s the irony of modern leadership —
We can now afford the ball, but not the bond.

True leadership, I believe, is about preserving that bond —
reminding people that we’re in this together, not against each other.

[Transition – Defining Your Leadership Style]

So when I think about my leadership style, I call it —
Human-Centered Leadership.

It’s not about how loud you speak in meetings,
it’s about how well you listen when someone’s quiet.

It’s not about giving perfect instructions,
it’s about inspiring imperfect people to do their best.

And most importantly,
it’s about remembering that leadership isn’t a solo performance —
it’s a team dance.

Sometimes, you lead.
Sometimes, you follow.
And sometimes, you just clap for others.

[Closing – Reflective + Humorous]

So the next time your doctor says,
“You have Vitamin D deficiency,”
Don’t just buy supplements —
maybe try absorbing some sunlight… and some leadership too! 

Because just like Vitamin D, leadership works best when it comes from within.

Don’t wait for someone else to lead you.
Don’t wait for perfect conditions.
Start with yourself.
Shine a little.
And help others glow too.

Because true leaders don’t just stand in the sunlight —
They become the sunlight.
