Part 1 – Building Suspense


Hey, how many of you agree with me that all days are not the same?
Some days give you so much energy that you can ride on it for a whole week, and some days… they drain you before you even reach the evening.

A few weeks ago, I had one of those draining days. By afternoon itself, I was exhausted. I closed my laptop, put it aside, silenced my phone, and decided—let me take a short nap. For me, that’s the quickest way to recharge.

But guess what? That “short nap” turned into a two… almost three-hour sleep. And in that sleep, something unusual happened.

I had a dream. And this dream—it wasn’t like any other.
I met someone. A girl.

She was so cute, so radiant… her smile was so powerful that even now, just thinking about it, I feel lighter, happier, more energetic.

But who was she? And what exactly made this dream so special for me?
I’ll tell you in the next part.


Part 2 – The Reveal & Conclusion


So, who was that girl?
She was just a little child—maybe two or three years old—who came into our house as a guest, along with someone I didn’t even recognize.

But the moment I met her, it felt magical.
I spent time playing with her… she ran around the room, holding random little things, and I found myself chasing after her, laughing, feeling this incredible joy I can’t even describe.

That dream—just those few moments with this little girl—charged me up for an entire week. I woke up smiling, and even through my busy schedule, that joy never really left me.

Honestly speaking, little children always bring me happiness. Their excitement over small toys, their laughter in the simplest of games, their pure way of seeing the world… it’s contagious.

And maybe that’s the lesson my dream was trying to tell me:
Sometimes, the energy we need doesn’t come from rest, or sleep, or even achievement… it comes from the simplest form of joy—like the smile of a child.
