Title : The Voices in My Head


Content : 

“Good morning, everyone!
I’m a little confused today… and it’s not because of the early hour.
There’s actually a huge fight going on… inside my head!
Yes, four people are arguing in there, and honestly… I don’t know who to listen to yet!”


“So I thought… why not introduce you to them this morning and see if we can figure out who’s really in charge?”



The Four Voices

👉 The Responsible One 

“Do the right thing. Stay disciplined.”

👉 The Lazy One 

“Relax yaar… naps are more productive than work.”

👉 The Adventurer 

“Let’s do something crazy! Road trip! Salsa lessons! Skydiving!”

👉 The Overthinker 

“But… what if something goes wrong? What if… what if… what if?!”


Now let me show you what happens when they all start arguing.

Incident 1 – Job Application

One evening, I decided to submit a job application… simple, right?
	•	Responsible: “Hey, just double-check everything before you submit.”
	•	Lazy: “Submit it anyway… this company is famous for rejection emails only.”
	•	Adventurer: “Let’s submit the resume… and in the cover letter, add a dramatic story about how you single-handedly saved a village, climbed Mount Everest, and taught a cat to code. That’ll get noticed!”
	•	Overthinker: “But… what if I get shortlisted and the interview is scheduled for tomorrow? Should I submit now or prepare first?”

Incident 2 – Going to the Gym

Sometimes, I think… maybe I should join a gym to get a perfect body.
	•	Responsible: “Yes! It’s good for health.”
	•	Lazy: “Please… you’ll just pay money and waste it. Better stay home with Netflix.”
	•	Overthinker: “But… what if I lift weights and hurt my back? Then no gym, no muscles, no fun!”
	•	Adventurer: “Bro! Forget one gym… let’s attend trial sessions of ALL gyms. Every week… new gym… new selfies… maybe even film a TikTok while lifting!”

Incident 3 – Mountain Trip

Sometimes, I dream of going on a mountain trip.
	•	Responsible: “Yes! Fresh air, nature, peace.”
	•	Overthinker: “But what if the car slips in heavy rain? Or a landslide blocks the road?”
	•	Lazy: “Save the trouble. Just put on a VR headset, sit near a fountain, and imagine mountains. Cheaper. Safer. And you still come back home.”
	•	Adventurer: “Forget comfort! Let’s go solo. Pack a tent, a cycle, a car… drift on mountain slopes like Fast & Furious!”

Incident 4 – Ordering Dinner

Even ordering food can drive me crazy:
	•	Responsible: “Eat something healthy and simple.”
	•	Lazy: “Just order the usual and forget the rest.”
	•	Adventurer: “Try something new! Paneer tikka, chaat, momos… live a little!”
	•	Overthinker: “But… what if the dish I pick turns out terrible? Bland, overcooked, or not even what I expected? Then I’ll regret it the whole meal!”

Climax

At first, I thought these voices were a curse. But then I realized… they’re all part of me.
	•	The Responsible one keeps me grounded.
	•	The Lazy one reminds me to rest.
	•	The Adventurer pushes me to explore.
	•	And the Overthinker… well, he ensures I don’t embarrass myself while trying new things.

Conclusion 

So now, when the voices start fighting inside my head… I don’t shut them up.
I let them speak. I laugh at them. And then… I make my own choice.


Because at the end of the day…

Closing Linel

The loudest voice in my head… should always be my own!
