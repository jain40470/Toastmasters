I just wanted to ask you all a question ?
1. Why we not let childrens to ride bicyle with 
supporting tyres their whole life ?


I have two different stories for you — one about a person named X, and another about a person named Y.

Both of them have different ideologies, follow different paths, and have their own ways of learning.

Let me explain with a simple example.

Once, during a physics class, students were asked a question:
“Tell me about a body that changes its mass while moving.”

Person X, based on his knowledge, answered “Human body.”
Person Y, who had already studied this question in coaching, confidently answered “Rocket.”

Both are students in the same B.Tech class.
Person X reached there through self-preparation, while Person Y got there with the help of coaching.

Now they are in their second year, and after one more year, companies will start coming to the college for placements.

As usual, Person Y joined coaching to learn coding — and coaching gave him a direct roadmap to prepare for placements.

Meanwhile, Person X, who is used to preparing on his own, decided to learn in his own way — by searching, exploring, and finding answers himself, instead of following a fixed path.

And now, the real game begins.

Person Y, following the proper roadmap, starts getting interview calls.
Person X, despite putting in the same hard work and consistency, fails to get calls.

The reason?
He hadn’t practiced the pattern-based questions before, and during the exams, he spent too much time trying to solve them from scratch.

Now let me ask you — who do you think is actually learning?

And how many of you believe that one day, Person X will succeed — that he’ll eventually get the fruits of his efforts?

You can feel his story, imagine his struggle, and believe in his effort…
But the people around him? They doubt his capability.

Why?
Because they can’t differentiate between spoon-feeding and self-feeding.

They only see one child riding a bicycle fast, and another struggling to balance.
But they fail to notice the supporting wheels that are secretly helping the first one.

And this misunderstanding pushes Person X into depression and anxiety.

So, who is the real culprit here?
The focused and innocent Person Y?
The system?
The people around?

No.
The real culprit is Person X himself — because he doubted his own capabilities.

You know, sometimes a plant takes time to grow.
You may water it consistently for 100 days, and it might sprout on the 101st day.
But if you stop watering it on the 99th day — all those 99 days go to waste.

So never doubt yourself.
Believe in your efforts. Believe in your hard work.
