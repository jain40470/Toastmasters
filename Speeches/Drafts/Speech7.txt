Speech: “The Physics of Life”

Everybody… close your eyes.
Don’t worry, this is not a meditation class.
And I promise — nobody’s going to steal your phone.

Now, what can you see?
Everything black, right?

Now imagine your life has come to an end.
You’re rewinding through all your years —
School days, your favourate dish,your favourate place or any memory .


Now slowly… open your eyes.

How are you feeling?
Good?
Feels nice to relive your memories, right?

Now tell me honestly 
How many of you thought about the times when you were stressed, anxious, or completely lost?
Very few? Or maybe none?

See, that’s the beauty of life.
When we rewind our memories, our mind skips the buffering part 
it plays only the highlight reel!

And that’s when I realized something 
Physics and Life are actually best friends.
Yes! The same subject that explains the universe also explains us.

Today I will be telling you the Three Laws of Physics
but not in a boring way.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First Law of Motion

A body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

Now, in simple life terms —
If you keep lying on the bed, scrolling through reels, you’ll remain there forever —
until your mom acts as the external force yelling,
“Uth ja! It’s 11 o’clock! Even the sun has gone back for lunch!”

That’s Newton’s first law in real life.

Sometimes that “external force” isn’t your mom — it’s life itself.
A failure, a rejection, a breakup.
And we feel like, “Why is this happening to me?”
But maybe it’s not happening to us — it’s happening for us — to get us moving again.

If Newton hadn’t been hit by that apple, he’d still be under the tree… updating his Instagram bio: “Dreamer. Thinker. Fruit lover.”

So next time life hits you with an apple — don’t complain.
Just discover your own law!

⸻----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Law of Motion

Force equals mass into acceleration.

In life, this means — the bigger your dreams (mass), the more effort (force) you need to accelerate.

You can’t expect to become a billionaire with the energy of someone watching Netflix and eating chips.

If your dream is big — your force must be bigger.

And acceleration doesn’t happen instantly.
Even rockets take time to lift off.
So if you feel stuck, don’t worry — you’re not failing, you’re just fueling.

The more consistent the force, the greater the motion.
Because success is not about one big push — it’s about many small pushes in the right direction.

⸻----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third Law of Motion

For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction.

In life, that’s karma.
You help others — others help you.
You smile — someone smiles back.
You spread negativity — it returns with a bonus.

Life always reacts.
Every action — every choice — sends a ripple somewhere.
And those ripples come back to us, sometimes when we least expect them.

So, if you want good reactions — give good actions.
Simple Physics, simple life.

⸻-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now when you combine all three laws —
When you’re at rest, life pushes you.
When you move, effort keeps you going.
And when you act, the world reacts.

Life itself is a motion experiment — we’re all just trying to find our balance.

⸻

You know, many people think Physics is just about formulas and numbers.
But to me, it’s more like a philosophy.
Because every law that governs motion… also governs emotion.

We all have inertia — that lazy voice saying, “Let’s start tomorrow.”
We all face friction — those obstacles slowing us down.
And we all seek momentum — that feeling when everything just flows.

But remember — as long as you stay in motion, you’re alive.

So, next time you feel stuck —
Think of Newton.
Don’t stay at rest.
Apply force.
And watch how the universe reacts.

Because in the end —
Inertia kills dreams,
Force builds futures,
And motion… keeps life beautiful.
