Title : “The Types of Students in My College”

Content : 

Good morning fellow Toastmasters and guests,

Now I will tell you the types of students I met in my engineering college.
And listen carefully, because in the end, I’ll ask you two questions:
	

Let’s begin!

⸻

Type 1 – The Hostel Ones
These students are a different species.
Their daily routine is very simple:
Sleep, eat, roam around in slippers, and ask for notes one hour before the exam.
Their hostel rooms look less like rooms and more like railway platforms—always crowded, always noisy.
But no matter what, they know how to create memories.

⸻

Type 2 – The CV Builders
These are the students who attend every event—not out of passion, but out of compulsion.
Technical fest? ✔️
Cultural fest? ✔️
Webinar on Blockchain in Agriculture? ✔️
They don’t even understand half the events, but they collect certificates like Pokémon cards.
Their motto: “Doesn’t matter what I learn, as long as I can put it on LinkedIn.”
Honestly, they look like students… but feel more like crowd fillers!

⸻

Type 3 – The All-Rounders
These are the happiest students.
They enjoy every lecture, make the class lively with their jokes, and still manage to do well in exams.
They bunk sometimes, they study sometimes, but somehow, they always maintain balance.
Basically, they are the ones who enjoyed both the journey and the results.

⸻

Type 4 – The Passion Chasers
These students hardly come to college.
If you see them in class, it’s like spotting a rare bird—once in a semester.
Why? Because their time and energy are invested in their passion.
One is performing music gigs,
one is practicing dance,
one is running a YouTube channel,
one is building startups,
and one is playing tournaments.

They may not attend lectures or even remember classroom roll numbers,
but when it comes to their passion, they are 100% present.
And they remind us that life is not just about attendance and grades—it’s also about following what truly excites you.

⸻

Type 5 – The Overthinkers
These are the freshers who enter college… and instead of enjoying the first year, they start worrying about the last year.
Day 1 of college, orientation just ended, and they’re already asking,
“Bhai, after engineering should I do MBA, M.Tech, or UPSC?”
I used to look at them and think—“Bro, you just got the seat today. At least sit on it before planning to leave it!”

⸻

Friends, when I look back, these are the students who made my college life colorful.
Some taught me how to chill.
Some taught me how to build skills.
Some taught me how to laugh even in exams.
And some… taught me what not to do.

Now, let me return to my two questions:

👉 Which student do you think I am?
👉 And according to you, which student enjoyed the most college life?

Honestly… I was a mix of all.
In my first year, I was both the Hostel One and the All-Rounder—enjoying classes, jokes, and still doing fine in exams.
By 4th semester, I became the Overthinker, worrying about placements and future plans.
Later, I turned into the Passion Chaser, skipping classes to explore what I truly loved.

Yes, there are things I regret not doing…
But when I look at the balance, I feel—I lived enough, I enjoyed enough, and I learned enough.

Because in the end, engineering is not just about the degree we get…
It’s about the person we become.

Thank you!
