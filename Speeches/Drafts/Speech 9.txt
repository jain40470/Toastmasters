Speech: “The Three Needles of Leadership”

How many of you want to be a leader?

(Hands go up)

Whenever I see all these hands, I feel like saying,
“If everyone wants to be a leader… then who’s left to follow?”

Because today, becoming a leader is as easy as saying:

Leader leader? — Yes Papa!
Relaxing on chair? — Yes Papa!
Working hard? — No Papa!”

But real leadership isn’t a title.
Real leadership… is like a clock.

We all look at a clock every day,
but almost none of us notice the three needles that quietly run our lives.

And today, I want to tell you a story through these three needles —
the Second hand, the Minute hand, and the Hour hand.

Their speed is different.
Their purpose is different.
But together… they make time move.

Just like leaders.

So let’s start with the first needle.

⸻

⏱️ 1. The Second Hand — Leading Yourself

(Fastest needle → your daily actions, discipline, decisions.)

The second hand moves quickly — tick, tick, tick.
It’s the loudest, most noticeable needle…
just like the actions you take every day.

And to explain this, let me take you back to school…

(Tell the full story of your artist friend — his choice, conviction, everyone’s doubt, his parents, his confidence, and his success.)

He wasn’t waiting for permission.
He wasn’t copying anyone’s dream.

His second hand was moving —
action, action, action.

And that’s when I understood:

The first needle of leadership is the Second Hand —
the courage to lead yourself in small daily steps.

Because without that… nothing else moves.

But the second hand can’t do everything alone.
So now, let’s shift our eyes to the needle that moves slower…
but reaches much farther.



⭐ Conclusion: The Clock Comes Alive

So when you look at a clock again,
don’t just see time.

See the story of leadership.
	•	The Second Hand — action, daily choices, leading yourself.
	•	The Minute Hand — trust, people, influence.
	•	The Hour Hand — vision, purpose, long-term impact.

Each needle alone means nothing.
But together… they make time move.

Just like leadership.

So today, I don’t want to ask:

“How many of you want to be a leader?”

I want to ask:

Which needle of your leadership is ready to move next?

Because when all three needles move together…
that’s when the world starts noticing you.

Now Let's talk about the needle that doesn’t shout,doesn’t rush.
But with quiet consistency , it creates real progress.

Its the minute's hand.

And that reminds me of another story.

55 people.
No big fancy company perks.
Just a small room.

And they’re handling billions of users.

This was WhatsApp before Facebook acquired them.

When someone asked one of their team members,
“How do you handle such massive scale with such a small team?”

He said one sentence that became a leadership lesson for me:

“Our founders didn’t give us tasks.
They gave us trust.”

Trust is like the minute hand.
It moves quietly , builds people, not just products and ultimately compounds into unimaginable results.

Because When you trust people… they grow.
When they grow… your mission grows.

ALways remember : A great leader doesn’t micromanage every second.
They empower every minute.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now Let's talk about the smallest needle of clock.

The hour needle.

You know beauty of this needle , 
this needle moves so quietly , that you hardly notice it.
But it decides the entire direction of time.
Just like vision decides the direction of leadership.

To explain this, let’s travel to Bengaluru… 2010.
and meet two brothers with a vision to “Make investing simple for every Indian.”

You know they weren’t moving like the seconds hand very fast to reach investors to make their 
vision quickly visible.

They were working so much quietly with focus to achieve that vision on each aspect whether
how to meet the consumer demand with tech and other aspects.

They worked day and night , ya the nigts in which only they can hear the hour hand sound (tun..) in silence.

This is the story of the Kamath brothers who built
Zerodha a multi-billion-dollar revolution , with zero outside funding and completely bootstraped.

So if you are just putting efforts with no clear vision , take a break 
might be you are moving in wrong direction.
