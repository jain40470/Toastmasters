Speech Title: “The Sun Is Shining, But We’re Still in the Dark”

Even in this scorching sunlight, people are low in vitamin D.
Isn’t that ironic?
We’re surrounded by the very thing we lack — yet somehow, we don’t absorb it.

And that’s not just about health.
It’s about life.
Today, we live in an age of unlimited knowledge — free courses, podcasts, tutorials, mentors, and AI tools — all shining brightly around us like sunlight.
But how many of us truly use them?
How many of us step out of our comfort zone to absorb what’s already within our reach?

It’s not the lack of light that keeps us in darkness — it’s our choice to stay indoors.

Maybe that’s why we scroll for hours instead of studying, or dream big but never take the first step.
We don’t need more opportunities — we need more absorption.
We need to stop complaining about what’s missing and start making use of what’s already here.

So next time someone says, “I don’t have the right resources,”
remind them —
even in this scorching sunlight, people are still low in vitamin D.
