Speech: “Trip”

A few months ago, after finishing my project and a lot of paperwork, I was completely exhausted.

As usual, on my way back home, I called my mom — not to ask how she was, but to ask what’s for dinner!
That’s my routine.

She said, “Tomorrow, one of our relatives is going to Sonagirji in Madhya Pradesh.”

After the call ended, I just paused for a moment and thought —
I haven’t even gone on a single trip in my entire college life!

Every single time, the plan starts with excitement and ends with… “Cancel.”
Every time my family plans a vacation, something happens —
Either my father gets busy with work, my brother has exams, or I end up having some urgent task.

But that day, I decided — no matter what, this time I am going.

So I called my mom again and said, “I’m going with them!”
She shouted, “Are you mad?”
She told me three things.
	1.	They booked their tickets a month ago!
	2.	Your father won’t allow such a sudden plan!
	3.	And even if all goes right, our relatives may not even take you… because, well, you’re the lazy and annoying one in the family!

But somehow, luck — or maybe courage — was on my side.
I called my dad, and he said yes.
And our relatives agreed too.

Now came the ticket problem.
You won’t believe this — they had one extra ticket!
It was for an old lady in their neighborhood, but she fell sick the day before.
For a moment, I felt… happy for her sickness! (Just kidding!)

That’s how I got on my first real trip and a kind of little adventure.
and You know the parents guided me and my brother in a way like 
we are still 7-8 years old.
Example :
1. Don't take food or anything from unknown in a train.
2. Don't show your reality to relatives in front of toy shops.

Then begin our life's first train journey.

You know, for a moment we thought we would be bored in a 7-hour travel.
But we were wrong — the environment of a train never lets you.

Inside the train, kids were laughing, vendors shouting “chai-chai,”
and that rhythmic chuk-chuk sound made everything feel alive.

After every hour, we moved to another city, with a completely different outside view 
green fields turning into small towns, then bustling stations filled with people carrying stories of their own.
Some were heading home, some chasing dreams, and some simply enjoying the ride like us.

It was as if the train wasn’t just taking us to a destination,
but showing us a movie of India through its window


Our relatives had planned to visit just one place.
But my brother and I — being true explorers — weren’t satisfied with that.
And somehow, we convinced them to extend the trip.

Earlier, I used to watch those ads where people ordered pizza on the train —
and this time, I was the one doing it!

While enjoying those slices, we started chatting with co-passengers,
asking them about nearby places to visit.
They shared stories, smiled at our excitement,
and we kept adding places to our list like little kids collecting treasures.

And that’s when I realized —
sometimes, the best journeys aren’t the ones perfectly planned,
but the ones that just happen along the way.
Because in the end, it wasn’t just about reaching the destination…
it was about every laugh, every new place, and every “chai-chai” that made the journey unforgettable.

And believe me, it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life.

That day, I also learned something very important —
The right time never comes; you have to create it.

Sometimes, you just have to be quick and take the chance.

So, if you’re delaying a trip, a dream, or maybe even a proposal —
Stop waiting for the right time.
Because sometimes, the “right time” is just an excuse.

Thank you.
