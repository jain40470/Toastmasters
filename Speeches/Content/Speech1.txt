Title : The wedding that never happened


Content : 

Think of a ...

A mighty fort glowing under the night sky
like those royal weddings we’ve seen in Jodhaa Akbar or Padmaavat.

Walls decorated with flowers, lamps shining like a thousand stars.

Drums thunder echoing through the air like a Coldplay concert… or a Diljit Illuminati show.

Nobles arriving from every corner of the land.

The excitement is electric
This doesn’t feel like just a wedding.
It feels like history is being written before their eyes.

But here’s the twist—
History remembers this wedding not because it happened… but because it never did.

This is the story of a prince.
A prince who had everything power, wealth, beauty, and a wedding the entire kingdom was waiting for.

His name… was Prince Neminath.

Now, Prince Nemi had a cousin. Not just any cousin—the playful, charming, flute-playing Lord Krishna. If Neminath was calm and steady like a mountain… Krishna was the river—sparkling, flowing, unstoppable.

At the wedding, Krishna was the life of the party. The fort was alive with joy elders smiling, children laughing, sweets disappearing in Krishna’s hands. 

And truly it was a wedding for the ages.

And the bride, Rajulmati, waited with excitement in her heart. The kingdom cheered. The moment had come.

And then came… the sound.
Not music. Not laughter. But a cry.

The cries of thousands of animals tied up for the royal feast.

Neminath froze. The crowd still cheered, but all he could hear… was suffering.
He asked, “Why are they tied?”
The answer: “For your wedding feast, my lord.”

And in that instant ,something shifted.

The prince who was about to marry… stepped down from the chariot.
He walked past the garlands, the gold, the throne.
He looked at the animals and whispered, “How can my happiness be built upon their pain?”

The crowd gasped. Some whispered, “Is he mad? Walking away from a princess? From a kingdom?”

Environmenr is like : Maat Jaao Neminath Rajul Pukare?

But Neminath walked on. Calm. Steady. Choosing not the path of celebration, but the path of compassion.

And here lies the twist 
centuries have passed, and no one remembers the grandeur of that wedding.
But everyone remembers… the wedding that never happened.

Because sometimes, the greatest victory is not in what we gain… but in what we let go.

Because true greatness is not in reaching the top of the mountain… but in making sure you didn’t crush anyone while climbing it.

That prince, who once stood at the gates of luxury, walked instead into history… as none other than the 22nd Tirthankara of Jainism—Lord Neminath.

But my friends, this isn’t just an old story. It is a mirror to our lives today.

The world celebrates ambition. We all want to rise higher, create a legacy, build an empire. And that’s good—dreams push us forward. Goals give us purpose.

But in this race to the top, many forget to look around.
Sometimes our success is built on someone else’s struggle, someone else’s tears, someone else’s silence.
We gain but at the cost of someone else’s loss.

And that’s where Neminath’s choice speaks to us. He had everything within his grasp—wealth, fame, power. But he chose compassion over celebration. Humanity over luxury.

I am not saying you should become a monk.
I am not saying stop dreaming , stop desiring.

But as you chase success—don’t trample on someone else’s heart.
Don’t break someone’s dignity.
Don’t silence someone’s emotions.

Because your empire will fade, your wealth will scatter…
But compassion—compassion echoes through generations.

And maybe… just maybe… like the wedding that never happened, people won’t remember the size of your empire or the shine of your jewels.

They’ll remember the compassion you showed, the humanity you carried, and the lives you touched.

That… is a legacy worth leaving behind.
