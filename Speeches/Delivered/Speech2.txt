Title : Artificial intelligence , Natural Blunders
L1/P2 

Content :

Good evening fellow Toastmasters and digital survivors,

Let’s play a game.
Raise your hand if AI has ever helped you.
Lovely.

Now raise your hand if AI has ever confused you.
Stronger connection, I see.

How many of you have been frustrated by AI?
Yes! That’s true bonding.

And now the final question:
Raise your hand if AI has impressed you so much, you forgave everything else.

Exactly.
This isn’t just tech. This is a relationship.

And like every relationship, mine with AI has everything:
Excitement. Cooking. Confusion.

So today, let me walk you through the rollercoaster of my toxic yet unbreakable love–hate relationship with AI.

It all started on a peaceful Monday morning.
I woke up feeling motivated, 
… I looked at myself in the mirror and said:
“Today, I will become the most productive, efficient version of myself, with AI as my trusty sidekick.”

So I asked Alexa to play something motivational to get me in the zone.

And she played… “Despacito.”

 I feel optimistic.
I thought AI would be like a loyal assistant: efficient, reliable, emotionless — but in a sweet, robotic way.

Then came the first real test of our relationship…

My college project report.
Topic: Machine Learning in XyZ
Length: 1500 words.
Deadline: Yesterday.

I confidently told ChatGPT:
“Write a smart report, but not so smart that my professor suspects I didn’t write it.”

It delivered.
The language? Flawless.
The structure? Bomb
The citations? From papers I didn’t even know existed.

I was happy

Until I ran it  AI detector.

100% AI-generated.

I stared at the screen like it had just cheated on me.

I begged ChatGPT, “Please make it sound human — add confusion, hesitation, maybe a typo… something that screams ‘college student under pressure.’”

After three emotional rewrites, it passed.

That was our first fight.
AI was brilliant, but emotionally unavailable.

But I forgave it. Because love makes you ignore the flaws.

After that exhausting mental drama, I needed comfort.
Some people meditate. Some people smoke
I decided to cook.

It writes, it codes — I thought, maybe it could handle my hunger too.

So, live on stage, I asked ChatGPT:
“Give me a recipe considering my favorite foods.”

You’d expect a wise suggestion like,
“Pick one, genius.”

But no.
ChatGPT confidently replied:
“Let’s make it.”

Hey everyone 👏 why not let’s make it together — and have ourselves a pizza party! 🍕

So as instructed, I took a pizza base,
stuffed it with creamy, cheesy macaroni,
added red sauce pasta on one side, white sauce on the other…

And for toppings?
Momos.

Honestly, it felt more like assembling the Avengers of Food.

You all can have yours ready while I bake mine in the oven!

At that moment, I had a serious dilemma:
“Does this already exist… or should I file a patent?”

Then it came out of the oven —
a masterpiece of confusion.

My sweet mom took one bite, smiled painfully, and said:
“Beta… it’s very… innovative. Don’t tell anyone.
They might steal the idea… and sue you.”

When I gave it to my dog, he was like,
“Bro, no jokes today.”

That day, I learned something important:
AI can throw all the ingredients into the ring…
But only a human can say:
“Bhai… yeh mat kar.”

So after all that drama… what did I eat?
Maggie.
2 minutes. 0 confusion. Pure peace.

After the report mess and pizza fail,anyone would just quit and chill.

But not me.
I’m Akash.
Quitting’s not in my playlist.

So I thought —
AI can debug code.
It can suggest recipes.
So why not debug my feelings…
or at least help me express them without crashing?

I asked ChatGPT:
“Send a sweet message to a girl I like.
Something romantic… but chill.
Just enough to keep the conversation going forever.”

And what did it give me?

“[Her name], your presence optimizes my emotional bandwidth and stabilizes my neural network.”

I wanted Shah Rukh Khan.
I got user documentation.

Still… I sent it.

She replied:
“Your proposal has been received and logged.
Emotional compatibility is under processing.
Please allow 3–5 business days for a heart-based response.”

Even she used GPT to send me a rejection message .
It seems more like 
“sorry, my heart is temporarily unavailable.
Please try again later.”

Now every time I see her, I’m reminded… even my rejection was AI-generated.


So, what’s the verdict?

AI is smart.
It saves time.
It writes, it cooks, it even flirts.

But it also confuses you, frustrates you, and sometimes embarrasses you — in front of everyone.

In short: AI is like a dramatic ex —
brilliant, but high-maintenance.


Like any tricky relationship, it’s all about balance.

Let AI help, but stay in control.
Let it cook, but always taste.
Let it write, but add your spark.
And in love… maybe just use emojis.

Because at the end of the day, artificial intelligence can do a lot —
But only real intelligence knows when to say:
“Thanks, robot. I’ll take it from here.”

So the next time AI ruins your project, your pizza, or your proposal — just smile and say:

“Beta… this is very… innovative. Don’t tell anyone.”
