Title : MY Race MY Pace

GOOD MORNING 


Image this 

You’ve just scored well in your 10th boards.
You’re happy. You’re proud.
You feel like you’re finally ahead in life—like you’ve won a race.
Then… you step into your new school.

Suddenly, the air changes.

Everyone around you isn’t just talking about classes or friends or fun.

They’re obsessed with one thing: something called JEE.

Not just talking—panicking, preparing, planning two years ahead as if they’re already halfway through engineering college.

And you?
You don’t even know what JEE stands for.

Kind of a strange feeling, right?

Yes , that was exactly how I felt like When I had entered a place where people were living in the future.

While I was still enjoying the afterglow of my board results, my new classmates were miles ahead—already buried in textbooks, mock tests, coaching classes.

Every other person had enrolled in some institute.
They were using words like “IIT,” “advanced level,” and “AIR rank”—and I was still figuring out which classroom was mine.

It all made me feel like I had missed a secret announcement.


At first, I was confused.
Then… curious.
And finally I was concerned.
Was I already behind?
Was I the only one not part of this movement?


———————

It’s human nature, right?

When you see everyone running in one direction, you feel the urge to run too—even if you don’t know where it leads.


So, like many others I decided to join a coaching institute.

For me It felt like stepping onto a race track where everyone had already taken off.
And the worst part? I didn’t want to be left behind.


Also I was bit late it was already June while others had started in March , some legends in 9th class even
but I found a weekend batch.


I still remember my first conversation there:
Me: “Ma’am, I’m late… will I be able to catch up?”
Ma’am: “Don’t worry, we’ll cover everything from the basics.”


And I believed her. I had hope.
But hope meets reality quickly.


Every day after school, I’d come home hoping for some rest, only to see another message—
“Extra class today as well.”

So now, weekends were booked, weekdays were stuffed, and school exams were approaching.
And then, things got worse.
We were merged with students who were far ahead.
They were solving complex problems.
I was still learning what the topic even meant.

They were running.
And I was barely walking.


Confusion took over.
Meanwhile, my school exams were coming.
Homework piled up. Coaching assignments kept coming.
I felt like I was drowning in expectations and confusion.

I didn’t know how to manage. I didn’t know what to prioritize.


Then came the golden words from one of my  teacher.
He said:
“Akash, you need to choose. Focus on one thing. Believe in one direction—school or coaching—as per your current level.”


It hit me.
Sometimes, the brave decision is not to speed up—but to step back.


And that’s when I made the tough decision.
I quit coaching.

To others, it looked like my JEE path had crumbled to dust


But for me, it was  something different


Without the pressure of coaching, I could finally had a “A time to breathe. To think.”
I reflected on my strengths.
I talked to friends who were preparing seriously.
Watched free  Resources.
Created my own pace, my own plan.

And most importantly—I stopped trying to run someone else’s race.


And Your Know In 11th, while many students struggled to balance school and coaching, scoring 50–60%,
I scored 89% and ranked second in class.


Why? Because I was no longer distracted.
I wasn’t juggling boats.
I was focused and steady


And here’s something many don’t believe:
By July itself, I had completed my 12th-grade mathematics syllabus.
Without coaching. Just with discipline , clarity and consistency.


Eventually , I cracked JEE and earned my spot at Delhi’s second-best University for B.Tech.


Now, you might think…
“That’s the win,” right?

 Can anyone guess what the real win was?

Well…
The real win wasn’t the rank.
It wasn’t the college name on my ID card.

The real win was this:

It’s the person I’ve become in this journey—
Confident, focused, strategic.
Someone who learns from others but doesn’t blindly follow them.
Someone who knows how to step back when needed.
Someone who trust his own pace , even when the whole world seemed to be running ahead.
Someone who doesn’t run every race just the right one.



If you ever feel lost, behind, or pressured to follow someone else’s path…
Take a deep breath. You’re not alone.
We all get caught up in that race sometimes.
But I urge you—

Pause.
And ask yourself:

1. Is this really my race?
2. Or just the crowd’s?

Because in that moment of stillness m you might hear the only voice that truly matters—your own.

And in that moment, tell yourself—

“It’s my race. I’ll run it at my own pace.”

That’s the race that truly matters.


Thank You
