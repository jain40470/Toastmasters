Speech: “Connection Before Communication”
L2/P2


Tell me—
how many of you miss your childhood… your school days?

Almost everyone, right?

Some of us miss the cartoons.
Some miss the holidays.
And I miss something even more valuable…

The ability to make friends… effortlessly.

You know, little kids are amazing at making connections.

Why?

Because they never worry about how to start a conversation.

No overthinking.
No self-doubt.
No “What will they think of me?”

Kids don’t rehearse conversations in their head…
they just press “Start.”

I still remember my school days—
same brand water bottle,
same geometry box…

And suddenly—best friends for life.

Back then, friendship didn’t need a profile…
just a pencil.


Even today, when I attend weddings or family functions,
I notice something fascinating.

Two kids meet.
They shake hands.
And then—boom!


By the end of the function, they’re inseparable…
and their parents are searching for them.

They don’t even ask:
• “Which class are you in?”
• “What’s your qualification?”
• “What package will you get after engineering?”

Because kids don’t network… they connect.

They just connect.
And then… their fun happens.

But as time passed…

Something changed.

Society slowly built invisible walls.

These walls are called:
• Profession
• Status
• Labels

And one powerful label entered our lives:

Introvert. Extrovert.

Now let me ask you something.

Is a person really an introvert or extrovert?

Or…
are they just in the wrong room?

Let me tell you my story.

As a child, I was an extrovert.
Very talkative.
Lots of friends.

But suddenly, in college…

I was declared an introvert… without my consent.


I started questioning myself.

Why am I not part of this group?
What am I missing?
What’s wrong with me?

So instead of blaming myself…

I started observing others.

And that’s when I discovered something important.

People don’t bond over studies or work.

They bond over common interests:
• Anime
• Avengers
• Football
• Movies
• Music

Your resume may impress people…
but your interests connect them to you.

These are the real connectors.

Then a difficult question came to my mind:

Should I adapt to others…
or should I change myself?

For a long time, I thought the answer was “No.”
“Why should I change for anyone?”

But after observing closely…

The honest answer surprised me.

Yes.
You need to adapt.

Not to lose yourself—
but to meet people where they are.

Because if you want people to listen to you…
you must first make them feel heard.


So I changed one simple thing.

Whenever I initiate a conversation now,
I don’t focus on what I want to say.

I focus on:
• Listening
• Understanding
• Discovering their interests

And once you do that…

You stop thinking about “what to say next”…
and start enjoying the talk.


Putting your point forward becomes easy.
The conversation becomes meaningful.
The connection becomes real.

And suddenly…

I realised something beautiful.

That childhood superpower never disappeared…
we just forgot the password.

So the next time you feel:
“I’m an introvert.”
“I don’t belong here.”
“I’m not good at conversations.”

Remember this:

You don’t need to change who you are.
You just need to connect where they are.

Because sometimes…

All it takes to turn strangers into friends
is a little attention… and genuine curiosity.

Thank you, fellow Toastmasters.
