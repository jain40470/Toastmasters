Title : A Sweet Lie , Becoming Me
L1/P1 

Content : 

The year 2000.

A new millennium begins — buzzing with hope, chaos, and youthful energy.

In the heart of it — a boy.
Young, fearless, full of charm.

He and his gang had a ritual:
Meet girls, drop random names, flirt a little — then vanish into the night.

Until one evening… at a ring ceremony…
He sees her — a girl from Meerut.

No hesitation.
A red rose.
A bold proposal.
“Hi, I’m Akash.”

It wasn’t just a random name.
It was the start of a long-distance love story.
And by 2002, they were married.

And in 2003, the fictional character who kickstarted their journey made a grand entry into their lives — not as a name, but as an annoying little child.

Back in my childhood, I was someone who lived entirely in the present. I’d come home from school, toss my bag aside, eat while watching Shinchan, and simultaneously finish my written homework. Even today, whenever I feel low, I just watch Shinchan — and somehow, it still brings a smile.

Then, right at 4 PM, I’d head straight to the terrace or the ground to play with friends until 8.

No tensions.
Hadn’t even heard words like stress, anxiety, or motivation.


One day, it was my father’s birthday, and there was also a PTM at school. I wasn’t really worried — PTMs felt like just another formality.

But during the meeting, my English teacher said,
“Akash is good at studies, but if he doesn’t start taking things seriously, his grades will go down.”

Ouch.
That hit me. On my dad’s birthday, of all days — and this was the kind of “gift” I was giving him?

What made it worse was… he didn’t even say a word. No scolding. Nothing.
And somehow, that silence felt even heavier than any lecture.

So, what did I do?
Came home, studied hard. Then harder.
You know — the usual emotional comeback story.

Sounds boring already, right?
One person taunts, the other cries, then becomes a topper overnight.

But wait — that’s not what actually happened.

Back then, my mindset was more like:
“It’s the teacher’s job to say things like that.”
And in all my childhood wisdom, I even thought,
“Maybe ma’am’s just trying to impress my dad by sounding super concerned about my future.”

Yes , That was me.
Taking feedback in from one ear… and letting it exit stylishly from the other.

Residence changed, school changed, and Akash changed too.
I started focusing more on my career and ambitions, becoming someone who truly worried about the future.

Then, I entered the race for the JEE exam, with:
Maths as my best friend,
Physics as my girlfriend,
And Chemistry as my crush — someone I liked but couldn’t quite get.

I studied hard, attended school regularly with discipline, and burned the midnight oil.
All that hard work paid off, and I got into a decent college.

Though I got into college, my mindset was still stuck in school mode.
I didn’t understand things like bunking classes or going out with friends.
There was even a class where I was the only one present out of 75 students.
(Humor)

But soon, I realized that I needed to focus on myself and develop new skills.
So, I started learning new technologies and participating in coding contests.

The more success I achieved in tech, the weaker my soft skills became.
I wasn’t even aware of it — I was happy with my contest ranks… until my interviews were scheduled.

I used to see less skilled people with great soft skills getting placed.

It was stressful. Everyone around me said it’s a game of luck. And slowly, I started to believe that too.

But then, a casual meeting with an old friend changed everything. Unlike others who just asked, “Are you placed?”, he went deeper. He pointed out my weak areas. This time, I didn’t ignore his words like I did during my PTM.

I got back to work. I restructured everything and focused more on the HR part.

And yes, within two weeks—I got placed.

But now the question was—should I continue working on my soft skills, or stop since the task was done?

I’m not the kind of person to stop here.

I decided to keep improving. I don’t want to face such a situation again. I’m now on a journey to make soft skills one of my core strengths. And I believe this club, and every member in it, will be there to support me along the way.

Thank You
