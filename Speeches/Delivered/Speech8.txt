Speech: “Best for You : Rethinking Mentorship”
L2/P3

Good morning everyone.

Let me start with a simple question.

Whenever we have to buy something—
a phone, a laptop, even clothes—
what do we usually choose?

The best.

Best brand.
Best reviews.
Best recommended by society.

I believe almost everyone here does the same.

And for most things in life, that works well.

But today, I want to talk about the biggest mistake of my life—
a mistake I made by applying this same logic…
to choosing mentors.

⸻

Whenever I wanted to learn something, I believed one thing very strongly:

“If I want to learn, I should learn from an expert.”
“If I need guidance, I should be mentored by the best.”

The best developer.
The best speaker.
The best leader.
The best influencer.

And yes, it helped me.
I learned a lot.

But somewhere along the way…
I missed something very important.

⸻

One day, someone asked me a very simple question:

“Who is your mentor?”

And suddenly…
my mind went completely blank.

I was thinking:

“Which domain mentor should I answer?”
Tech mentor?
Religious mentor?
YouTube influencer mentor?

I realized something shocking.

I was learning from many people,
but I didn’t feel mentored by anyone.

That question stayed with me.

And that’s when Toastmasters entered my life.

⸻

When I enrolled in Toastmasters, I was given four names to choose from as a mentor.

Out of those four:
	•	Two people, I had never even met.
	•	The remaining two—I knew a little.

One of them was our club president.

In my mind, the decision was already made.

She was the president.
She was a great speaker.
She clearly had leadership skills.

I thought:
“She is the best.
So obviously, she should be my mentor.”

Honestly, I didn’t even bother learning about the other person.

I had already fixed my plan.

⸻

But life had a different plan for me.

She was not assigned as my mentor.

For a moment, I felt sad.

I thought,
“I missed the best opportunity.”
“I missed the best mentor.”

But that moment—
whether fortunately or unfortunately—
became the turning point of my understanding.

⸻

When my new mentor was assigned, something unexpected happened.

I expected guidance in speech writing and presentation.
Instead, he first took time to understand me - my conversations, my social growth, and the areas I needed to improve.

Through his guidance, I found my voice and the confidence to use it.

Most importantly, he changed my understanding of what a mentor truly means. and I realized that : 

A mentor is not someone who is an expert in every field.
A mentor is not someone who knows everything.
A mentor is not someone with the highest position or title.

A mentor is someone you can trust.
Someone who listens to you.
Someone who guides you, not judges you.

My mentor didn’t  give me polished answers.
But my mentor always gave me discussion time on answers

And that changed everything.

⸻

That’s when I finally found the answer to my question.

Let me explain it other way.

Imagine two people in your life.

Person A gives you money.
Helps you for a moment.

Person B teaches you skills,
opens doors,
creates opportunities,
and sometimes even brings luck into your life.

Person B doesn’t just help you today—
they shape your tomorrow.

Person B is your mentor.

⸻

I realized I was wrong all along.

I was choosing mentors the same way I choose products—
based on popularity, expertise, and society’s approval.

But mentorship is not about who is the best in the world.

It’s about who is best for you.

⸻

Today, when someone asks me:

“Who is your mentor?”

I no longer think about domains.

Not tech.
Not religion.
Not social media.

I think about the person who believed in me
when I doubted myself.

The person who listened
when I was confused.

The person who walked with me,
not ahead of me.

⸻

So my message to you today is simple:

Don’t choose mentors because society says they are the best.
Choose mentors because your growth feels safe with them.

Because the best mentor
is not chosen by status…
not chosen by title…
but discovered through trust.

Thank you.
