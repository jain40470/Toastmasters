Speech: “The Three Needles of Leadership”

L2/P1

How many of you want to be a leader?


Whenever I see all these hands, I feel like saying,
“If everyone wants to be a leader… then who’s left to follow?”

Because today, becoming a leader is as easy as saying:

Leader leader? — Yes Papa!
Relaxing on chair? — Yes Papa!
Working hard? — No Papa!”

But real leadership isn’t a title.
Real leadership… is like a clock.

We all look at a clock every day,
but almost none of us notice the three needles that quietly run our lives.

And today, I want to tell you a story through these three needles —
the Second's needle, the Minute's needle, and the Hour needle.

Their speed is different.
Their purpose is different.
But together… they make time move.

Just like leaders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So let’s start with the needle that is most noticeable needle
and sounds like tick, tick, tick just like the quick actions you take every day.

and to explain this, let me you a story 

Tell me five companies that hires engineers.
Tell me five  company that hires artist.
You can't

so We were two friend's in school , i decided to pursue 
engineering which society welcomes.

But my friend decided to choose art as his carrer.

So how his parents welcomed his decision.

He was told you can join business and later on once settled do it as your hobby.
He replied once i become a great artist , then i will join.

For many , it seems he was arguing.
but actually he was very much confident on his skills.

and Truly His second's needle was moving 
action, action, action.

Today , when i see he is very much satisied with his actions,

And that’s when I understood:

The first needle of leadership is about courage to lead yourself in small daily steps.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now Let's talk about the needle that doesn’t shout,doesn’t rush.
But with quiet consistency , it creates real progress.

Its the minute's hand.

And that reminds me of another story.

55 people.
No big fancy company perks.
Just a small room.

And they’re handling billions of users.

This was WhatsApp before Facebook acquired them.

When someone asked one of their team members,
“How do you handle such massive scale with such a small team?”

He said one sentence that became a leadership lesson for me:

“Our founders didn’t give us tasks.
They gave us trust.”

Trust is like the minute hand.
It moves quietly , builds people, not just products and ultimately compounds into unimaginable results.

Because When you trust people… they grow.
When they grow… your mission grows.

So friends always remember : A great leader doesn’t micromanage every second.
They empower every minute.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now Let's talk about the smallest needle of clock.

The hour needle.

You know beauty of this needle , 
this needle moves so quietly , that you hardly notice it.
But it decides the entire direction of time.
Just like vision decides the direction of leadership.

To explain this, let’s travel to Bengaluru… 2010.
and meet two brothers with a vision to “Make investing simple for every Indian.”

You know they weren’t moving like the seconds hand very fast to reach investors to make their 
vision quickly visible.

They were working so much quietly with focus to achieve that vision on each aspect whether
how to meet the consumer demand with tech and other aspects.

They worked day and night , ya the nigts in which only they can hear the hour hand sound (tun..) in silence.

This is the story of the Kamath brothers who built
Zerodha a multi-billion-dollar revolution , with zero outside funding and completely bootstraped.

So if you are just putting efforts with no clear vision , take a break 
might be you are moving in wrong direction.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So Now let me quickly summarize the three needles for you 

	•	The Second's Hand : the actions 
	•	The Minute's Hand : trust and relationships , how many people you empower
	•	The Hour Hand — vision and purpose

Each needle alone means nothing.
But together , they make time move.

But the question arise , which leadership needle you need to move when 
to be a great leader.

Let me tell you simple way :

Do daily actions to strengthen your skills ,
while doing those actions empower others , help them and support them.
You should have a clear vision of yours as direction.

That you will see the magic !
